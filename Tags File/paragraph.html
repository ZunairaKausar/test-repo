    <pre style="font-size: large;">
        Twinkle Twinkle little stars.
        How I wonder what you are?
        Up above the world so high.
        Like a diamond in the Sky.

    <p>If we use 'br' tag we can break a paragraph or a line</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">For Example</h2>
    <p>For example, say you wanted to write a paragraph about dogs. The first thing you would do is write a 
        topic sentence, such as, “When it comes to animals, dogs are a great pet.” <br>Now you have a topic, 
        which is not just dogs, but talking about what makes dogs a great pet.After you’ve come up with 
        your topic sentence, you will then have to write three to five sentences that help you explain 
        your fact. <br>For example, in the paragraph about dogs, you may want to write about the different 
        things people do with dogs as their pet. <br>The following sentences would be great for a paragraph 
        about dogs.
