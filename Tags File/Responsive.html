    <p style="color:  solid black;">Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature,
         and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans
          all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other 
          necessary components.You are walking through town at night and you see your best friend looking 
          dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. You haven’t seen him for six months. There is probably 
          an initial shock: “Oh my God, what happened?!!” You instinctively reach out for him. Before you know
           it your arm is on his shoulder: “Come home with me. Let me take care of you”.Now another night. 
           This time you see a random stranger looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. Be honest. 
           What do you do? Is it someone else’s problem? If your heart is big enough you might give him some 
           money or buy him a sandwich but is he coming home to sleep on your couch? Perhaps you rationalise 
           your inaction by reminding yourself that you donate to the local homeless charity. You might remind 
           yourself to vote for a politician who appears committed to doing something. But most of the time 
           most of us don’t do anything at all. means very little to know that a million Chinese are starving 
           unless you know one Chinese who is starving.” There needs to be an emotional connection</p>
